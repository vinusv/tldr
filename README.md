## What on earth is this abomination?
This document is, at its very basic nature: an *About Me* for folks who directly/indirectly report to me at SN TPS.

Seems narcissistic? I agree. However that is truly not the intent. In these times, with our remote setups, I hope this provides you a useful context.

It will help you in understanding
- What is my role?
- My typical way of working
- Some principles/values I completely vouch for or practice or yearn to practice.
- Trivia, fun facts and general FAQ!

It is hopefully not
- My first touchpoint with you.
- A substitute for in-person dealings.
- A static document that will never be updated.

## What is my role?
I am the Head of Development for SND Pune and local point of contact for the Global SND department. I also represent this department/division in my role as part of the SN TPS Management Team. My job description in the context of SND [is present here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vf5beGvCd6gKhCa2B-4f9aedAJJHhDqt/).
I do have other responsibilities as part of the management team in SNTPS.

I report to Matthias Wissel as well as James Maggs.

I still code.

## My typical way of working

### Meeting me
*For Catch-ups, as one of the ones in our One-on-Ones, the skip in the Skip Levels, the board in the Sounding Board, the duck in your Duck Coding journey or simply as a friend.*

I do not hold traditional views regarding hierarchy, boundaries or communication. What this implies is that regardless of whether you report to me or not, you can
- Reach out to me.
- Whenever you need. Depending on your urgency. Regular business hours is preferred of course, but I've often been accused of responding at any hour :P
- Through Slack, Email, Whatsapp, Phone, Tapping my shoulder, yelling across the canteen. Whatever works.
- I generally consider myself terrible at multi-tasking in the context of meetings. 

Caveats: I am forgetful, if things are not organized. Therefore, if we decide to meet at a later time, do remind me to block your time OR block my time yourself if you feel like.

### Values<sup>\*</sup>

This section is rather trite and I think no one ever flubs it. No one will ever say, "I love to micromanage" :P

Nevertheless, this section outlines things I think are important to me
- I do believe in strong ethics. If you work with me, you will hear the words "ethical" & "unethical" quite frequently.
- Transparency by default.
- I believe in rational thinking and while this may feel like it is a positive thing, in some situations it isn't so. I am less intuitive and more data driven. Working with me will also introduce you to endless ~~possibilties~~ google sheets and reports. 
- A strong focus on the human element of working together.
  I tend to believe I am here to support you and have your best interests at heart. A belief that's more on the lines of: I trust you completely. Until you repeatedly prove me wrong.
  This describes me, imo, rather accurately within situations where I have control in decision making and when it does not clash with my obligations to the organization.
  I agree this gets complicated when I do have to make difficult decisions.
- Diversity, Inclusivity and being treated equally. I call out, and I hope I continue to have the courage to call out, instances where I perceive this not to be the case.

\* This does not imply you agree with me or my values. I'm sure there is
a consequence of me being a lead/supervisor/"boss" that prevents you
from taking this at face value. Maybe you've even experienced the
opposite of what I'm saying. I acknowledge that there is always going to be a power imbalance. This also means, in most cases, I have to take the first step towards working on our relationship, instead of expecting you to do the same.

### Feedback

This is something we are all weak at: Giving & Receiving feedback. I have [this open form](https://forms.gle/4uScdjj6xbaZPn7A7) to enable you to send over anything that you think is relevant.

Direct 1 on 1s are personally the best way to do this, but I will surely understand if that is not something you are comfortable with.

## About Me
### Professional
- I have been with SN TPS since 2016 and in this role since 2018.
- Before SN TPS I have had the opportunity to work with different technologies/frameworks/methodologies/people/cultures.

### Personal
<sup>And also a tip to the topics that you can engage with me on</sup>
- I am multilingual and I still love learning new languages which has progressively declined with age :P. I'm pretty much fluent in English, Hindi, Marathi & Malayalam. I learned German in school and I've fallen in love with Spanish for now.
- I'm an amateur photographer, marathoner and artist and I love playing football/chess.
- I grew up poor and have had a difficult childhood in terms of struggles, albeit a happy one. I grew up (and am still) surrounded with strong women who inspired me and a hell lot of books. A lot of my values and the way I work/behave are shaped by my background.

### Quirky shit that you need to be aware of
- I tend to have a pronounced accent when speaking to people who are not Indian in origin. It will sound hilarious. Do not laugh (I feel bad inside :P)
- My face keeps changing. You'll know when the seasons change.
- [A weird ethical vegetarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovo-lacto_vegetarianism) who hates eggplants and is still tempted by meat/seafood.
- I prank people I am comfortable with.
- I laugh at the silliest things.

### Mind Map | tl;dr
Just in case you wanted an illustration instead of a wall of text.
